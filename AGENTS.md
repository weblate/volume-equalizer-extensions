# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- Core browser extension manifest lives in `manifest.json`; popup markup is in `popup.html` and pulls styles from `resources/styles/popup.css` plus icons/images in `resources/icons` and `resources/images`.

- All runtime logic is TypeScript modules in `src/`.

- Localized strings sit in `_locales/<lang>/messages.json`; keep keys consistent across languages and match `__MSG_*__` tokens in markup and scripts.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm ci` (or `npm install`): installs dev dependencies; there is no bundler or transpile step.

- `npm run build`: runs build using vite with custom script (`tools/buildExtension.mjs`)

- `lint:locales`: validates length of strings and lines count for some buttons

- `npm test`: runs unit tests using vitest

- Packaging: zip `dist/` for store uploads after build; avoid including `node_modules/`.

## Do not patch symptoms

- When fixing bugs, do not add quick workarounds whose only purpose is to make the current case pass.

- Treat such changes as a temporary stub, not a real solution.

- Your goal is to find and fix the actual root cause of the error. Before changing code, investigate why the failure happens, where the incorrect assumption is, and what part of the system is responsible.

Avoid fixes like:

- swallowing errors without understanding them

- adding special cases just to satisfy one scenario

- forcing values into a valid shape without knowing why they are invalid

- retrying, ignoring, or bypassing failing logic

- making the code “just work” while leaving the underlying issue unresolved

A correct fix should explain and address the real cause of the bug, not merely hide its effects.

## Avoid redundant validation layers

- Normalize and validate external input once at the boundary where it enters the system, then pass the resolved value through internal functions.

- Do not call the same fallback/validation helper repeatedly through nested helper chains unless the value can be modified or become invalid between calls.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Use 2-space indentation, semicolons, and `const`/`let` over `var`; prefer arrow functions and early returns to mirror existing files.

- File names are camel case (`drawSpectrum.ts` style); functions and variables use `camelCase`. Keep DOM ids/classes in `kebab-case` as seen in `popup.html`.

- Favor double quotes in TS/JS/JSON to stay consistent with current code and locale files.

## Localization

- When adding UI text, create English copy first at the end of `_locales/en/messages.json`, then mirror keys across other locales and translate values; avoid hardcoded strings in markup or scripts.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
